# Overview

- A file is a sequence of records. records could be fixed size or varirable size
- Block is the unit of data transfer between disk and memory.
- When block size(B)>record size(R) each block will contain numerous records
- Based on the ability to cross block bounderies when storing records
	- spanned records
	- Unspanned records
- Methods of allocating blocks on disk
	- Contiguous Allocation: consecutive disk blocks
	- Linked Allocation: each block contains a pointer to the next
	- Index Allocation: index blocks contain pointers to actual blocks
- Methods of storing records in files
	- Unordered records: no order. placed in the file as they are inserted
	- Ordered Records: ordered based on a field value(ordering field)
	- Hashing: storing the data on the address that is generated by applying a hash function to a key field.



## File Indexing
Types of indexes  according to the number of index entries
- Dense index(has an index entry for each record of the table)
- Sparse index(only to some entries. Generally for each block)

Types of indexes according to key field used in the table
- Single Level Ordered Indexes
	- [[Primary index]]
	- Secondary indexes(index on non-ordering field)
	- [[Cluster indexes]]
